This project shows the ability to create a simple webpage with a text form, centering of elements with CSS, creating a header and footer, along with creating proper spacing and formatting with CSS.
I will add additional comments at the end of this project.

The appearance of this project resembles the google homepage, though the underlying code does not. As of Dec 2019, I do not have the knowledge to create an exact replica of google's code. I expect that with more web development experience I will be able to use similar tools as the google developers. 

This project works best on Firefox browser.
